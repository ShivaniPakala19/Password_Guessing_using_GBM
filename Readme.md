<h1>Password Prediction using Gradient Boosting Machine</h1>

This project leverages the Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) algorithm to predict passwords based on patterns observed in a dataset of 20,000 passwords. The model was trained and evaluated to achieve an accuracy of 96.5%, demonstrating its effectiveness in cybersecurity research. The implementation includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation, all developed using Python in Visual Studio and deployed using Docker.

The project highlights potential security vulnerabilities and emphasizes the importance of strong password policies. Future enhancements may include incorporating deep learning models and expanding the dataset for improved prediction accuracy.
